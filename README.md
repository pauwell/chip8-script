# Chip-8 Script

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pauwell/chip8-script.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pauwell/chip8-script)


Chip-8 Script is built to provide a thin layer of abstraction over the native chip-8 opcodes.
This project has just started, please feel free to contribute in any way.

* :fire: The `easy` way to create chip-8 ROMs.
* :fire: Using variables with meaningful names instead of managing chip-8's registers. 
* :fire: You can easily predict to which opcodes your code will compile. 
* :fire: `if-conditions` and `for-loops` do not produce any overhead.
